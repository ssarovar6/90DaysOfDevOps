# 🚀 90DaysOfDevOps
### Learn • Build • Practice • Become Job-Ready

Welcome to **90DaysOfDevOps**, a structured and hands-on DevOps challenge by **TrainWithShubham**.

This repository is designed to help you **build real DevOps skills step by step in 90 days** — not by watching endless videos, but by **doing daily tasks**, building projects, and thinking like a **production-ready DevOps engineer**.

This is not a theory-heavy course.  
This is a **discipline + execution challenge**.

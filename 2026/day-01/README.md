# Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud

## Task
Today’s goal is to **set the foundation for your DevOps journey**.

You will create a **90-day personal DevOps learning plan** that clearly defines:
- What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
- Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
- Where do you want to reach?
- How you will stay consistent every single day?

This is not a generic plan.  
This is your **career execution blueprint** for the next 90 days.

---

## Expected Output
By the end of today, you should have:

- A markdown file named:  
  `learning-plan.md`

or

- A hand written plan for the next 90 Days (Recommended)


The file/note should clearly reflect your intent, discipline, and seriousness toward becoming a DevOps engineer.

## Guidelines
Follow these rules while creating your plan:

- Mention your **current level**  
  (student / fresher / working professional / non-IT background, etc.)
- Define **3 clear goals** for the next 90 days  
  (example: deploy a production-grade application on Kubernetes)
- Define **3 core DevOps skills** you want to build  
  (example: Linux troubleshooting, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes debugging)
- Allocate a **weekly time budget**  
  (example: 2–2.5 hours per day on weekdays, 4-6 hours weekends)
- Keep the document **under 1 page**
- Be honest and realistic; consistency matters more than perfection

## Why This Matters for DevOps
DevOps engineers succeed not just because of tools, but because of:

- Discipline
- Ownership
- Long-term thinking
- Ability to execute consistently

In real jobs, no one tells you exactly what to do every day.  
This task trains you to **take ownership of your own growth**, just like a real DevOps engineer.

A clear plan:
- Reduces confusion
- Prevents burnout
- Keeps you focused during tough days
